This directory will contain the different velocity models used throughout the
 project. All velocity models will be kept. Reference to the velocity model
 used for a different processing step will be stored in the QuakeML objects.
 When doing interactive processing, it should be possible to select the
 velocity model. By default the velocity used should be the velocity model
 that was last used.

 Velocity will change throughout the project but will only apply to a
 particular time period.
